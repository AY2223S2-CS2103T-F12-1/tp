### What is Docedex?
Docedex is a **desktop application for managing doctors and patients within hospitals**, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type fast, Doc√©dex can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.<br>

### For users
