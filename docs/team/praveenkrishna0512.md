### Docédex

Docédex is a **desktop application for managing doctors and patients within hospitals**, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type fast, Docédex can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.<br>
