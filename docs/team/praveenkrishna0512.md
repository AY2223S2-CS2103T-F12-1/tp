### Docedex

Docedex is a **desktop application** built for **medical administrative assistants**
to manage doctors and patients within clinics.

Here's a **quick snapshot** of how Docedex can help you
streamline your hospital management processes.
- Store and edit information about your patients and doctors
- Track the status of your patients and doctors
- Assign patients to doctors upon triaging

On top of these functionalities, we believe that patient management must be **efficient**.
Therefore, Docedex is **optimized for** use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI).**
If you type fast, Docedex can get your hospital management tasks done faster
than current GUI apps in the industry.
