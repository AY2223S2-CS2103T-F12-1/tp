Docédex is a **desktop application for managing doctors and patients within hospitals**, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type fast, Docédex can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.<br>

3. Place the jar file into a new folder. This folder will be used as the home folder for the Docedex application.

4. Open a command terminal within the home folder.

5. Enter `java -jar docedex.jar` in the command terminal
   1. You should notice the GUI of the application pop up.<br>

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`list-doc`** and pressing Enter will display all doctors stored in Docedex.<br>
   1. Some example commands you can try:

      * `help` : Opens up the help menu.

      * `add-doc n/John Doe p/98765432` : Adds a doctor contact named `John Doe` to Docedex.

      * `del-doc 3` : Deletes the doctor with the associated ID of 3.

      * `find-doc Gabriel` : Finds all doctors contacts that have the keyword 'Gabriel'

      * `exit` : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list-doc`, `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## FAQ

**Q**: How can I load data from another computer into Docedex installed on another computer?<br>
**A**: Delete the `docedex.json` file (stored at `[JAR file location]/data/docedex.json`) from the computer that you wish to use Docedex on. Then, copy over the `docedex.json` file from the computer which you no longer wish to use Docedex on. After which, boot up Docedex to check whether your doctor information is properly loaded into the new computer.
