## Implementation

### Enlarged Info Card feature
As triage staff manage the contacts of doctors and patients, they may wish to pull up
the personal information of the doctor or patient. Therefore, the right-most column within
Docedex has been reserved to show the personal information of the selected doctor or patient.

![](images/enlarged-contact-card-display.png)

Let's call the card which displays this information **info cards**. However, the information
displayed for a doctor compared to a patient has a few differences. Thus, two different info cards
are required - one to display patient information and one to display doctor information.

Let's call these cards `EnlargedDoctorInfoCard` and `EnlargedPatientInfoCard`. Now, we need a way
to toggle between displaying either card, depending on whether the user has selected a doctor
or patient to view.

We will focus on the user clicking on a `DoctorCard`, though the ideas below can extend to
the `PatientCard`, as well as other ways of querying for a doctor or patient
(ie. through select-doc command).

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**
We hope to target admin staff within a clinic who have to settle triaging of patients.<br>
Here are some characteristics of our target user profile: <br>
* needs to assign patients to the appropriate doctors quickly
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Perform quick lookup and assignment of appropriate doctors to each patient in triage, faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.


### User stories

In the table below, **_user_** refers to the triage admin staff.

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

### Non-Functional Requirements

2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 doctor contacts and 30,000 patient contacts without noticeable reduction in performance.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. Should not utilize any network to transmit any information.
5. The average time required to boot up the application should be under 5 seconds.
6. Feedback from Docedex should be displayed within 2 seconds of the user's input.
