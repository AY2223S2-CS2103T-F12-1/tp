## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**
We hope to target admin staff within a clinic who have to settle triaging of patients.<br>
Here are some characteristics of our target user profile: <br>
* needs to assign patients to the appropriate doctors quickly
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Perform quick lookup and assignment of appropriate doctors to each patient in triage, faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
